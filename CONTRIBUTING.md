# Contributing Cordova-Framework
Whether you're trying to give back to the open source community or collaborating on your own projects, knowing how to properly fork and generate pull requests is essential.
Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

- Fork the repository.
- Make the fix.
- Submit a pull request to the project owner.

If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!

At the heart of open source is the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software.

### Fork the repository
##
Forking a repository is a simple two-step process.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/nb-systems/Cordova-Framework/">https://github.com/nb-systems/Cordova-Framework/</a> repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

That's it! Now, you have a fork of the original <a href="https://github.com/nb-systems/Cordova-Framework/">https://github.com/nb-systems/Cordova-Framework/</a> repository.
